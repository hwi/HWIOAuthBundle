Step 2x: Setup Salesforce
=======================
First you will have to register your application on Salesforce. Check out the
documentation for more information: https://help.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/remoteaccess_oauth_web_server_flow.htm

**Please note that Salesforce requires your callback url to be in HTTPS.**

Next configure a resource owner of type `salesforce` with appropriate
`client_id`, and `client_secret`.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml

hwi_oauth:
    resource_owners:
        any_name:
            type:                salesforce
            client_id:           <client_id>
            client_secret:       <client_secret>
```

When you're done. Continue by configuring the security layer or go back to
setup more resource owners.
