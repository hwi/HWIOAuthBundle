Internals: Configuring an external Resource Owner
=================================================
This bundle has tons of built-ins Resource Owners (Github, Trello, Google, etc..) that extends
[`GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner`](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/master/OAuth/ResourceOwner/GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner.php)
and [`GenericOAuth1ResourceOwner`](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/master/OAuth/ResourceOwner/GenericOAuth1ResourceOwner.php).

This is idyllic because with these ones, you just need to give basically a `client_id`,
`client_secret` and a few other configuration values and you are up and running with these.
Furthermore, these Resource Owners implements many useful methods like `refreshAccessToken` or
`revokeAccessToken` that might be handy in your projects!

You can even directly rely on our generic Resource Owners in your config, adding 4 more parameters,
`access_token_url`, `authorization_url`, `infos_url` for OAuth1 and
additionally `scope` for `OAuth2`. A little bit of configuration overhead, but in a few more
minutes, you are up and running with these.

But in some cases, implementation of providers does not strictly follow `OAuth1` or `OAuth2`
standards and for such providers you cannot use our generic Resource Owner without adjusting them
to needs of those specific providers.

I.e. you should check
[`WunderlistResourceOwner`](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/master/OAuth/ResourceOwner/WunderlistResourceOwner.php),
where the method doGetUserInformationRequest was overwritten to be replace header names.

Good news, you could do so in your project, without having to endure all the submission and pull
request process here on the bundle to define your own Resource Owners (but a nice PR is still
appreciated though if it could be useful for other. But __at least__, you can implement it quickly
on your side without having to wait that we merge it here).

To do so, you'll just have to create your Resource Owner class in your project, extending either
[`GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner`](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/master/OAuth/ResourceOwner/GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner.php)
or [`GenericOAuth1ResourceOwner`](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/master/OAuth/ResourceOwner/GenericOAuth1ResourceOwner.php).


```php
use HWI\Bundle\OAuthBundle\Security\Core\Authentication\Token\OAuthToken;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;
use Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolver;

use HWI\Bundle\OAuthBundle\OAuth\ResourceOwner\GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner;

class YourResourceOwner extends GenericOAuth2ResourceOwner
{
    // Your resource owner code here.
}
```

And then in your Resource Owners configuration:

```yaml
resource_owners:
    your_provider:
        type:           oauth2
        class:          'Your\Namespace\YourResourceOwner'
        client_id:      %oauth.your_provider.client_id%
        client_secret:  %oauth.your_provider.client_secret%
        scope:          %oauth.your_provider.scope%
```

That's all folks!
